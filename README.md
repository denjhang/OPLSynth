# OPL3 synthetic real instrument experiment
 I spent a lot of time experimenting with the OPL3 Bank Editor, starting from the DMXOPL3 sound bank and gradually approaching the sound of a real instrument. To make the 2x2op sound of OPL3 close to the sound of real instruments, in addition to repeated experiments, it also requires perceptual knowledge of OPL3 FM synthesis. At present, I am used to using OPL3 to model the sound of musical instruments. Of course, all this is done in the brain. I don't use FFT software to analyze the sound, I just use my ears and brain.
For DMXOPL3, only a small amount of modification is needed to make the instrument sound more realistic and "high-fidelity", but this requires a brain capable of sound structure ðŸ§ . 
Yamaha FM synthesis made my description of sound more concrete, and OPL3 synthesis brought a new kind of thinking. So much so that when I hear any sound, I will use "OPL3 thinking" to think about how such a sound is composed. 
Through a lot of experiments, the FM synthesis parameters closest to real instruments can be found by chance. I think this is suitable for artificial intelligence to solve. 
I currently have a perceptual understanding of OPL3 sound synthesis, and I have roughly figured out what effects certain parameters will bring through exploration. 
In fact, many of my sounds here start from DMXOPL3. 
OPL3 can use a variety of waveforms, 2x2op mode, which is easier to understand than the pure sine wave synthesized OPM, OPN series. 
Changing the waveform is more significant to the sound than changing the algorithm. 
I actually recently made a realistic solo violin sound, but that requires an external reverb to achieve a good effect. 
For familiar instruments, I will deconstruct these sounds in my brain, mainly the overtones of the instrument, and approach the sound in memory through constant experiments.

At present, I have achieved high fidelity on the two instruments of Harpsichord and Accordion, and I have also made variant sounds of many instruments to be closer to real instruments. For the piano sound, it currently sounds more like a synthesized sound. 
These OPL3 instruments feature "native FM reverb", you don't need to add any post-processing DSP reverb to hear crisp instrument sound and moderate reverb.
These are all music in VGM format, you can play them on MegaGRRL (OPL3) without any problem 
I have some newly made OPL3 music packs, which are the original OPL3 instruments I adjusted by myself, which can subvert many people's perception of the sound of OPL3 to some extent.ðŸ˜…
